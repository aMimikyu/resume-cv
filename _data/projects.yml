    Organized and managed an introductory workshop to teach first-year students the basics of java within the context of the IEEE Student Branch.
    Across multiple sessions I walked them through the process of creating a basic chat application and the java fundamentals that are needed for it.
    Topics included OOP, IO, Exceptions, GUI, Networking and Multihtreading.

    Created an Android mobile application using WEKA and data provided by the University of Coimbra to predict whether a person had breast cancer or not. Testing the
    application using patient data resulted in an accurate prediction about ~75% of the time.
    While the accuracy doesn't match the accuracy provided by top hospital applications, this project served as a great introduction to machine learning and mobile development.
