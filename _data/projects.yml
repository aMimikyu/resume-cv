    Organized and managed an introductory workshop to teach first-year students the basics of java within the context of the IEEE Student Branch.
    Across multiple sessions I walked them through the process of creating a very basic chat application and the java fundamentals that are needed for it.
    Topics included OOP, IO, Exceptions, GUI, Networking and Multihtreading.
